# FastAim
This is a color aimbot a created in a couple hours by joining together some files from other projects I made.
It uses [FastFind](https://github.com/FastFrench/FastFind/tree/master) a library which has helped me a lot before when I started to program this kind of things in Autohotkey and Autoit.

It makes use of [Interception](https://github.com/oblitum/Interception) to emulate the mouse movement.
Be aware that this method might be detected by some AntiCheats, I have only tested it in Fortnite, CsGo 2 Gamers Club and Paladins so far. 

Also the screenshot method of the FastFind library is quite old and there are some better alternatives, but implementing all the FastFind functions to other screenshot system would take a considerable ammount of time.

There is still many ways to optimize this and add new features but I will leave it as it is for now because it was just a one day project to use with the fortnite Thermal Vision and share with some friends.
